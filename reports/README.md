### [Epi Data Brief 1: Social Determinants of Mammogram Use Among New York City Women](reports/01-mammogram_brief.pdf)

The aim of this data brief is to investigate the disparities in mammogram use among women over 40 years old in New York City (NYC), based on race, ethnicity, and access to primary care providers (PCPs). Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women, and mammograms are effective in reducing the likelihood of getting breast cancer. However, there are disparities in mammogram use due to historical racial and ethnic discrimination and limited healthcare access among certain groups. 

Using data from the 2019 NYC Community Health Survey (CHS), we analyzed the mammogram usage of 3,283 females over 40 years old, exploring the relationship between mammogram use, social determinants of health, and healthcare access. The data analysis was conducted using R, with the script `01-mammogram_use.R` in the `scripts` folder. The dataset used in the analysis is "chs2019_public.sas7bdat", which is included in the `data` folder.

The analysis shows that access to a Primary Care Physician (PCP) is a critical factor in mammogram use among women over the age of 40. Women who have a PCP are more likely to receive mammogram screening, indicating that healthcare access and quality are crucial in affecting mammogram use outcomes. Although white, non-Hispanic women over 40 had the highest rate of mammogram use, the distribution of other racial and ethnic groups using mammograms roughly mirrored the city's population. The findings suggest that one's access to a PCP may be a more significant influence on mammogram use outcomes than their racial and ethnic identity. However, we must remain mindful of the structural barriers to healthcare access due to race and economic status. In particular, Hispanic women face more significant challenges in accessing PCPs due to cultural, language, or economic barriers. Initiatives like the New York State Cancer Services Program provide free screenings for uninsured, eligible New Yorkers and aim to reduce economic barriers to healthcare.

The findings of this study will provide valuable information for healthcare providers and policymakers to develop targeted interventions to increase mammogram use and reduce health disparities among different racial and ethnic groups in NYC.

### [Epi Data Brief 2: Social Determinants of Birth Control Use Among NYC Women](reports/02-birth_control_brief.pdf)

This data brief examines the differences in birth control usage by race and ethnicity among women ages 25-44 in NYC. It also explores the associations between income and length of birth control usage (short-term vs long-term) and how they differ by race and ethnicity, with a specific focus on the social determinants of health, including structural racism and economic inequities. The study aims to provide more clarity on the target population, which will inform the efficacy of programs like Planned Parenthood and NYC Health Sexual Health Clinics, which provide low-cost services, including contraception.

The data used in this brief is from the 2019 NYC Community Health Survey (CHS), which collected information on a range of health behaviors, conditions, and risk factors for New York City residents. The sample included 1345 observations, where women among the ages of 25-44 who were sexually active and had at least one partner of the opposite sex were included. The data analysis was conducted using R, with the script `02-birth_control_access.R` in the `scripts` folder. The dataset used in the analysis is "chs2019_public.sas7bdat", which is included in the `data` folder.

The analysis shows that race is not a determining factor in birth control use among women aged 25-44. While some differences were observed, particularly among Asian women, they were not statistically significant. Most women across races used some form of contraceptive, with a preference for condoms, implants/IUD, and the pill. The study also found that income was not a determining factor for the associations between race and birth control length. NYC health programs and insurance coverage laws may have contributed to this outcome. However, the subset sizes for each racial category were a limitation, and younger women may have different reproductive care experiences than older women. The results suggest that both structural and interpersonal factors influence birth control use. While structural factors make it easier to access birth control in certain spaces based on race and age, interpersonal factors regarding the burden of responsibility for reproductive care need further exploration.

By examining the birth control usage among women of different races and ethnicities and exploring the factors that may contribute to disparities in usage, this brief provides important insights into the social determinants of health that impact reproductive health outcomes.
