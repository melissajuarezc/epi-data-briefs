## Data Brief Reports

- [Epi Data Brief 1: Social Determinants of Mammogram Use Among New York City Women](reports/01-mammogram_brief.pdf)
The aim of this data brief is to investigate the disparities in mammogram use among women over 40 years old in New York City (NYC), based on race, ethnicity, and access to primary care providers (PCPs). Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women, and mammograms are effective in reducing the likelihood of getting breast cancer. However, there are disparities in mammogram use due to historical racial and ethnic discrimination and limited healthcare access among certain groups. 

Using data from the 2019 NYC Community Health Survey (CHS), we analyzed the mammogram usage of 3,283 females over 40 years old, exploring the relationship between mammogram use, social determinants of health, and healthcare access. 

The data analysis was conducted using R, with the script `01-mammogram_use.R` in the `scripts` folder. The dataset used in the analysis is "chs2019_public.sas7bdat", which is included in the `data` folder.

The findings of this study will provide valuable information for healthcare providers and policymakers to develop targeted interventions to increase mammogram use and reduce health disparities among different racial and ethnic groups in NYC.

- [Epi Data Brief 2: Social Determinants of Birth Control Use Among NYC Women](reports/02-birth_control_brief.pdf)
This data brief examines the differences in birth control usage by race and ethnicity among women ages 25-44 in NYC. It also explores the associations between income and length of birth control usage (short-term vs long-term) and how they differ by race and ethnicity, with a specific focus on the social determinants of health, including structural racism and economic inequities. The study aims to provide more clarity on the target population, which will inform the efficacy of programs like Planned Parenthood and NYC Health Sexual Health Clinics, which provide low-cost services, including contraception.

The data used in this brief is from the 2019 NYC Community Health Survey (CHS), which collected information on a range of health behaviors, conditions, and risk factors for New York City residents. The sample included 1345 observations, where women among the ages of 25-44 who were sexually active and had at least one partner of the opposite sex were included.

The data analysis was conducted using R, with the script `02-birth_control_access.R` in the `scripts` folder. The dataset used in the analysis is "chs2019_public.sas7bdat", which is included in the `data` folder.

By examining the birth control usage among women of different races and ethnicities and exploring the factors that may contribute to disparities in usage, this brief provides important insights into the social determinants of health that impact reproductive health outcomes.
