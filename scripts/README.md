## Scripts
This folder contains two R scripts that were used to create the data analysis for the Epi Data Briefs in this repository:

- `01-mammogram_use.R`: This script contains the code used to analyze mammogram use in New York City. It includes the code used to clean and preprocess the data, as well as the code used to generate the charts and tables included in the data brief.

- `02-birth_control_access.R`: This script contains the code used to analyze birth control access in New York City. It includes the code used to clean and preprocess the data, as well as the code used to generate the charts and tables included in the data brief.

Both scripts are well-documented and include comments explaining each step of the data analysis process.
