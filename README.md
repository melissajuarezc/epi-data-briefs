## Epi Data Briefs
This repository contains two data briefs that explore access to mammograms and birth control usage in New York City using data from the New York City Community Health Survey (CHS) conducted in 2019.

## [Data Brief 1: Mammogram Access](reports/01-mammogram_brief.pdf)
In this data brief, I investigate the usage of mammograms in New York City. I explore the demographic factors that are associated with mammogram access, and examine the differences in access between different groups. I provide an overview of the data analysis methods used and present on the implications of the data, as well as include recommendations for NYC in light of the analysis.

## [Data Brief 2: Birth Control Usage](reports/02-birth_control_brief.pdf)
This data brief was a group project, with contributions from Alexa Chan, Catherine Flores, and Jessica De Rocco. However, all of the data analysis and code was created by me. This data brief examines the differences in birth control usage by race and ethnicity among women ages 25-44 in NYC. It also explores the associations between income and length of birth control usage (short-term vs long-term) and how they differ by race and ethnicity, with a specific focus on the social determinants of health, including structural racism and economic inequities. The study aims to provide more clarity on the target population, which will inform the efficacy of programs like Planned Parenthood and NYC Health Sexual Health Clinics, which provide low-cost services, including contraception. We provide an overview of the data analysis methods used and present on the implications of the data, as well as include recommendations for NYC in light of the analysis.
