## Epi Data Briefs
This repository contains two data briefs that explore access to mammograms and birth control usage in New York City using data from the New York City Community Health Survey (CHS) conducted in 2019.

## Data Brief 1: Mammogram Access
In this data brief, I investigate the usage of mammograms in New York City. I explore the demographic factors that are associated with mammogram access, and examine the differences in access between different groups. I provide an overview of the data analysis methods used and present on the impications of the data, as well as include recommendations for NYC in light of the analysis.

## Data Brief 2: Birth Control Usage
This data brief was a group project, with contributions from [Name 1], [Name 2], and [Name 3]. However, all of the data analysis and code was created by me. In this data brief, we analyze the usage of birth control in New York City. We investigate the prevalence of different types of birth control, the demographic and socioeconomic factors that are associated with birth control usage, and the differences in usage between different groups. We provide an overview of the data analysis methods used and present on the impications of the data, as well as include recommendations for NYC in light of the analysis.
